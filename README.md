ML Voice assistant.
One of my first pet projects. I made it following terrible tutorial and ended up putting it together myself, which was challenging.
I used speech_recognition, dialogflow, pyttsx3, keyboard libs for backend and voice recognition and also tried to use PyQt6 to give it GUI. I stoped after i created starting window with the button< which will start the assistant if pressed.
